# RushHour
RushHour is a sliding block puzzle. To win you must move vehicles out of the red car's way and slide it out of the board through the lateral exit located on its lane. A vehicle may only be moved along its lane, forward or backward, and can't go over any other vehicle nor change lane. There are four levels of difficulty: easy, medium, hard and expert. Have fun!
